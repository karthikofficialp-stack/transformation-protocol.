The "4-Hour Protocol"

Hour 0:00 - 0:15 | The Primer (No Code)

Review yesterday's broken code.

Write down the exact micro-feature you will build today (e.g., "Make the button save data to the array").

Rule: Do not open YouTube. Do not open email.

Hour 0:15 - 1:15 | The Concept (Input)

Study one specific concept (e.g., "React useEffect dependency array").

Read the official documentation.

Output: Write a summary of the concept in your own words in a "Knowledge Log."

Hour 1:15 - 3:15 | The Build (The Grind)

Absolute Focus. Phone in another room.

Build the feature defined in The Primer.

When you get stuck: Do not switch to a tutorial. Read the error message. Console log everything. Struggle for at least 15 minutes before searching for a solution.

This is where the transformation happens. The pain is the point.

Hour 3:15 - 4:00 | The Refactor (Consolidation)

Clean your code.

Comment your complex logic.

Push to GitHub with a descriptive commit message.

Crucial: Write down exactly where you are starting tomorrow.
